# optics1-raytracer

## Development Prerequisites
*optics1-raytracer* should run on any modern browser, but you will need a set of tools in order to develop it.
*optics1-raytracer* is mostly written in Javascript, and depends on the [*Webpack* module bundler](https://webpack.js.org/).

To get Webpack, you will need to install [a recent version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and run the command `npm install`
inside this app's directory. For more information: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows

If you want to make a quick change *without* having to use Webpack, you can just edit the `dist/bundle.js` file, which contains the
compiled code in a somewhat human-readable format. Just search for `js/index.js` (or the file you are interested in) and edit the 
contents to your liking.

### Compiling the code
To compile all the JS code from `src` into the `dist/bundle.js` file, run the following command:
```bash
node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

The above command can be set to run indefinitely, watching for changes and automatically compiling your code:
```bash
node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch
```

## Directory & File Structure
* **`css`**: Contains the stylesheet for the HTML page
* **`dist`**: Contains the compiled JS code for the app. The files in this folder are automatically generated by webpack.
* **`imgs`**: Contains some of the graphics used in the application.
* **`src`**: Contains the **main source code**.

* `index.html`: The main entry point of the webpage
* `spectrum.c`: A C program to calculate RGB values based on wavelengths, based on http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/specrend/.
